Lab Submission:

1) Please submit the Source code (zip all .c, .h, and makeFiles). Also submit a MS word file which consist all output-screenshots and required explanations.

2) Please submit a recorded-video which explains how you implement the lab and demonstrate how it works. This will give everyone the opportunity to present their solution. Please record a video (2~5 minutes) with the following contents:

Introduce yourself (I would like to see your face in some part of the video, so I can recognize you later when we see each other at the campus :) )
Show/demonstrate how your assignment works.
Explain your code (walkthrough), how you design it ( a quick/detailed walk-through of the programming )
Speak about challenges that you faced during this lab.
Evaluate yourself. Have you implemented all requirements of the assignment? how do you evaluate yourself out of 10 for this assignment?
NOTE: You can record the video (mp4 or mkv format) using some screen-capture software (like OBS : https://obsproject.com/ ). To submit the video:

You can upload the video on the youtube (you may make it unlisted) and submit the link here.
You can also directly upload the video to the BB.
